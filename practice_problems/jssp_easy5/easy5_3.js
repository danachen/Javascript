// Reverse number

// Input: integer; output: integer reversed

/*
Approach 1: dis-match any 0, converse into string, split into array, reverse, built string, turn into number

Approach 2:
- Divide by 10 until the number is less than 10, insert remainders into an array if the remainder is not 0
- Add elements of array into a string, turn string into a number
