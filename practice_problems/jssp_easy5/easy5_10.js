// Reverse it part 2

// Input: string; output: certain string element is reversed

/* Approach: 
- Break down string into arrays
- New array constructed, using if, if > 5 chars, goes into another condition
- If less than 5 chars, just push it into the array
- In the other if branch, using for loop to string together a new string variable starting from the back
- Push that into the new array as well
- Turn arrach into string
