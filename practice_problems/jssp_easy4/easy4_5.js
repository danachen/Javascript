// Combine two lists
// Input: two arrays; Output: criss cross of two arrays

// Method 1: Construct a new array, iterate through one of the two arrays, then add one index at a time
// Is there also a #zip method that can zip through both arrays and return a new array?

// Method 2: Combine two arrays
// Then construct a new array and push to it each index i and i + 3, until it reaches the mid-point of the new array
