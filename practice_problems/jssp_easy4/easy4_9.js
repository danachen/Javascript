// How Many
// Input: number of occurrences of each element; Output: a hash of unique strings and occurrences, console printed

/*
- similar to a previous problem, a method like #each_with_object would've been perfect
- but for JS, create a new hash, then step through the array
function counterFunc (el of vehicles) {
  newHash[el] += 1;
  return newHash;
}

function countOccurrences(vehicles) {
  var newHash = counterFunc(vehicles);

  // Need to find a way to go through a property and print out the keys + "=>" and values
}
