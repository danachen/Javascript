// When Will I Retire

// Prompt asks age
// Prompt asks when one would like to retire
// Console logs the current year and the year one will retire (age of retirement - current age + current year)
// Console logs you only have (age of retirement - current age) to go

// Need to remember how to accept and print out a console prompt
