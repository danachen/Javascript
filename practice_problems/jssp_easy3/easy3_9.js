// Letter counter 1

// Input: a string of characters; output: a hash that displays the number of chars for words and the # of occurrences

// A new hash will need to be constructed, in Ruby it would be the each_with_object method
// In JS?
// First break the string down into an array, iterate through each element
// An array of strings, I can count each string's length

/*
var counter = {};
for (el of newString) {
  counter[newString.length] += 1;
