// A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, 
// with all of its digits occuring exactly once each. 
// For example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 
// 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

// Write a function that takes an integer as an argument, and returns the next 
// featured number greater than the integer. Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.

function featured(num) {
  
}

console.log(featured(12));           // 21
console.log(featured(20));           // 21
console.log(featured(21));           // 35
console.log(featured(997));          // 1029
console.log(featured(1029));         // 1043
console.log(featured(999999));       // 1023547
console.log(featured(999999987));    // 1023456987
